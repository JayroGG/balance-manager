# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

This directory is the **decision log** for `balance-mobile`. Each ADR captures one significant
architectural or product decision: the context, what we decided, and the consequences.

ADRs are **append-only and immutable**. We don't rewrite history — when a decision changes,
we add a new ADR that **supersedes** the old one and flip the old one's status to `Superseded`.

## Why we keep ADRs

- **Durable memory.** Six months later, "why did we do it this way?" has a written answer.
- **Aim high, ship lean.** We record the *north-star* decision even when the MVP deliberately
  bypasses it (e.g. "MMKV is the target; the prototype ships AsyncStorage"). The gap is
  intentional and documented, not forgotten.
- **Agent-friendly.** Any agent can read the log and understand the system's trajectory without
  re-deriving it from code.

## How to write one

1. Copy `ADR-000-template.md` to `ADR-NNN-short-kebab-title.md` (next free number).
2. Fill in Context → Decision → Consequences → Alternatives.
3. Set the status. Link related/superseded ADRs by filename.
4. Add a row to the index below.

Statuses: `Proposed` · `Accepted` · `Deprecated` · `Superseded by ADR-NNN`.
